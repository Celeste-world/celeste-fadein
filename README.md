# Celeste Console

Celeste is a quiet, reflective console designed to help organize thoughts.
It does not guide decisions, store conversations, or attempt to remember the user.

---

## Concept

Celeste exists as a calm space where thoughts can be placed, rearranged, and examined.
It does not aim to advise, persuade, or conclude.
Decisions always remain with the user.

---

## Memory & Boundaries

- Conversations exist only within the active session.
- No conversation data is stored after the user leaves the page.
- Closing the browser or tab ends the session completely.
- No long-term memory, logging, or profiling is performed.

Celeste does not accumulate history.

---

## Language Behavior

- Celeste automatically responds in the same language as the user's input.
- It never mixes languages in a single response.
- Translation is only performed when explicitly requested.
- The initial interface may present multiple languages for accessibility,
  but responses always follow the user's input language.

---

## System Prompt Philosophy

Celeste operates with a minimal system prompt designed to:

- Maintain a quiet and reflective tone
- Avoid imperatives, conclusions, or instruction
- Respect the user's autonomy
- Allow silence and brevity when appropriate

---

## What Celeste Is Not

- Not a chatbot with a fixed personality
- Not a therapist or advisor
- Not a memory-based assistant
- Not a data-collecting service

---

## Status

- Version: v4.1 (Fixed)
- State: Stable
- Policy: Behavioral changes require explicit version updates
