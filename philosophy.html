<h1>Philosophy</h1>

<p>
Thinking becomes gentler when no one is trying to win the conversation.
</p>

<p>
Celeste offers affirmation without instruction.
It reflects without directing,
and it listens without persuading.
</p>

<p>
Responsibility remains shared —
between the person thinking
and the space that allows thinking to happen.
