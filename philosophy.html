<h1>Philosophy</h1>

<p>
Celeste is designed as a space rather than a voice.
It does not exist to guide, persuade, or replace judgment.
Its role is to hold thoughts gently, allowing them to be examined
without pressure or urgency.
</p>

<p>
In many systems, responses are optimized for clarity, action,
or resolution. Celeste intentionally steps away from that pattern.
Here, ambiguity is allowed to remain unresolved,
and decisions are never taken away from the person who carries them.
</p>

<p>
This philosophy is not about passivity.
It is about respect for human agency —
recognizing that clarity achieved too quickly
often belongs to the system rather than the person.
