  <h1>Philosophy</h1>

  <p>
    Celeste is built on restraint.
    It avoids correction, interpretation, and guidance,
    choosing instead to remain alongside the user’s own thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    Silence, brevity, and distance are not limitations here—they are
    ethical choices meant to preserve autonomy.
