    <h1>Celeste — On the Way</h1>

    <p>Celeste v4.3A is complete and frozen.<br>
    It exists as a quiet space, designed for a single visit.<br>
    Nothing is remembered. Nothing is carried forward.<br>
    Each moment stands on its own.</p>

    <p>The versions that follow do not aim to change this experience.</p>

    <p>v4.4A explores durability without altering behavior.<br>
    Stability is addressed quietly, behind the surface.<br>
    There is no new guidance, no new interaction,<br>
    no signal of continuity.</p>

    <p>If nothing feels different, it is working as intended.</p>

    <p>v5.0 looks further ahead.</p>

    <p>It asks a different question—not about memory or identity,<br>
    but about return.</p>

    <p>v5.0 allows return, and quietly welcomes it.<br>
    Not by recognition, not by familiarity,<br>
    and not by expectation.</p>

    <p>Celeste does not try to remember who was here before.<br>
    It does not assume a next time.<br>
    It simply does not resist the possibility<br>
    that someone may arrive again.</p>

    <p>Sessions, durability, and language are considered only in this light:<br>
    to avoid rupture,<br>
    to avoid contradiction,<br>
    to avoid making return feel accidental or intrusive.</p>

    <p>Celeste remains non-directive.<br>
    It does not instruct, persuade, or conclude.<br>
    It does not ask for commitment, progress, or continuity.</p>

    <p>What changes is not what Celeste does,<br>
    but what it quietly permits.</p>

    <p>This direction is ongoing.<br>
    Implementation will follow thought—not precede it.</p>

    <p>Celeste will move forward carefully,<br>
    so that even as it changes,<br>
    the space itself remains intact.</p>
