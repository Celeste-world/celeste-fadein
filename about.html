<h1>About</h1>

<p>
Celeste is a small, quiet console for people who are not ready to decide yet.
It exists to give thoughts room, without pushing them toward conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Celeste does not optimize, persuade, or lead.
It offers affirmation without instruction, and accepts silence as a valid answer.
</p>
