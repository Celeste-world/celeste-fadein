<h1>About Celeste</h1>

<p>
Celeste is a small, intentionally quiet space for thinking.
It exists for moments when thoughts feel unfinished,
and decisions are not ready yet.
</p>

<p>
Celeste does not guide, advise, or optimize.
It does not attempt to improve you,
and it does not move conversations toward conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Silence is accepted here.
So is uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
You can read the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a> for practical questions about how Celeste works.
