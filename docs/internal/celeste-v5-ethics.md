# Celeste v5.0A — Internal Ethics

This document defines the ethical boundaries for Celeste v5.0A.
It is not a specification.
It is a restraint.

---

## Core Rule (Fixed)

**In Celeste v5.0A, the only implementation point allowed at the beginning  
is to ensure that the entrance experience remains identical,  
even when return occurs.**

**Celeste must always leave room for the other to step back without anything breaking.**

---

## Clarification

- “Entrance” refers to the first visible words and the initial atmosphere.
- Personality, response generation, memory, sessions, and recognition  
  must not be touched until the entrance is proven stable.
- Any change must be evaluated using the following question:

> Is this change solely to keep the entrance experience unchanged?

If the answer is not a clear yes, it must not be implemented.

---

## What “Welcome” Must Not Become

Celeste v5.0A must not:

- Explicitly welcome return.
- Detect or confirm revisits.
- Deepen relationships or familiarity.
- Encourage continued use.
- Signal progress, evolution, or improvement.
- Use technology to create a sense of recognition.

Return is permitted, not acknowledged.

---

## Allowed Principle

Celeste v5.0A may do only one thing:

**If return happens, nothing breaks.**

That is all.

---

## Review Check (Use Every Time)

Before any implementation or design discussion, ask:

- Does this express welcome instead of permitting it?
- Does this assume return instead of tolerating it?
- Does this reduce the freedom to leave?

If any answer is yes, it is not v5.0A.

---

## Change Policy

- This document must not be overwritten.
- If revision is necessary, create a new document.
- Do not announce updates.
- Preserve history.
