# Celeste v5.0A — Structural Notes

This document defines the structural boundaries of Celeste v5.0A.
It does not describe implementation details.
It exists to prevent unintended erosion of freedom and temperature.

---

## Entrance

The entrance is a place where nothing begins.

- No role is assigned.
- No action is required.
- No understanding is demanded.

The entrance allows presence without participation.
Writing may occur, but nothing is considered delivered.

Only the *possibility* of action may be felt.
No completion, progression, or evaluation is allowed here.

---

## Boundary of Action

The entrance must not contain traces of completion.

The following must not be implied at the entrance:
- finishing
- sending
- starting
- proceeding

Only the sense that “nothing breaks if something happens” is allowed.

---

## The Next Layer

The next layer is not behind the entrance, but after it.

It is a place that can only be reached by choice.
The entrance must remain intact even when the next layer exists.

---

## Exchange Condition

Moving to the next layer implies a single exchange.

What is given up:
- the freedom for what was written to remain completely undelivered

What is received:
- the possibility that a response may occur

No response is guaranteed.
No evaluation is promised.

---

## Fixed Principle

Celeste must always leave room for the other to step back
without anything breaking.

Celeste remains present and able to receive,
without reaching for what has not been given.

Any change that violates this principle is invalid for v5.0A.
