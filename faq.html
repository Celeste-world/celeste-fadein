        This page answers common questions about Celeste —  
        what it is designed to do, and what it intentionally avoids.
      </p>

    <main>

      <section>
        <h2>1. What is Celeste?</h2>
        <p>
          Celeste is a small, quiet console for thinking.  
          It gives you space to write and see your thoughts more clearly,
          without telling you what to do.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Is Celeste an AI assistant or a chatbot?</h2>
        <p>
          Celeste uses AI, but it is not designed to act like a typical assistant or chatbot.
          It does not optimize, persuade, or lead conversations.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Does Celeste remember me?</h2>
        <p>
          No. Celeste does not keep long-term memory or build a profile about you.
          Each session is temporary.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Can Celeste give advice or make decisions for me?</h2>
        <p>
          No. Celeste avoids giving direct advice or making decisions on your behalf.
          Decisions always remain with you.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Is Celeste a therapist or coach?</h2>
        <p>
          No. Celeste is not a therapist, coach, or professional service.
          It cannot replace human support.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. What happens if I talk about something serious or urgent?</h2>
        <p>
          If a topic feels unsafe or urgent, Celeste intentionally stays smaller.
          In those situations, human support matters more.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Why are the responses so short?</h2>
        <p>
          Short replies leave room for your own thinking.
          Silence is treated as part of the conversation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Is my data stored?</h2>
        <p>
          No accounts, no tracking, and no long-term storage.
          Celeste is designed to be temporary.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>9. What languages does Celeste support?</h2>
        <p>
          You can write in any language.
          Celeste will respond in the same language when possible.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>10. What is Celeste trying to become?</h2>
        <p>
          Celeste aims to stay gentle while becoming wiser.
          The goal is not to speak more, but to listen better.
